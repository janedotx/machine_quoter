A brief explanation of the mathematical assumptions used:

In order to detect convexity/concavity, I walk the vertices in clockwise order. If, for the current vertex I am on, I am on a
circular edge, and that edge is drawn in an anti-clockwise direction relative to the clockwise direction I am facing, that
circular edge must be concave. To facilitate figuring out which direction is clockwise, I assume that one point of the shape is
at the origin. The current clockwise finding logic won't work on all shapes, but it works for the examples I have.
